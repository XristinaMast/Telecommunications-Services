## Introduction

The **Telecommunications Services Project** aims to explore different aspects of telecommunications through practical coding exercises and simulations. The project is designed for students, developers, or telecom enthusiasts who want to understand how various telecom systems work under the hood, whether it's call routing, network management, or service billing.

This project covers multiple services typically seen in telecommunication systems and is implemented in the **C programming language**.

## Features

- **Service Management**: Simulation of basic telecommunication services like call routing, data management, and network service handling.
- **Card Game Simulation**: An additional feature includes a simple card game system, where players can choose cards and compare them for fun.
- **Scoring System**: An easy-to-follow points system to determine the winner in the card game based on card selection.
- **Telecommunication Simulations**: Core programs designed to replicate telecommunication services (this could include more specific features, depending on the project content).
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the programs in this repository, you will need:
- A working C compiler (such as GCC).
- A terminal or command-line interface to run the compiled programs.

### Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XristinaMast/Telecommunications-Services.git
```

### Compile the Code

Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run, and use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile the code. For example:

```bash
cd Telecommunications-Services
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
```

Replace `program_name` and `source_file.c` with the actual program name and file.

## Usage

### Running the Card Game

The card game allows two players to select cards, and the system determines the winner based on the matching cards.

To play the game, compile and run the corresponding C file:

```bash
gcc -o card_game card_game.c
./card_game
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to select cards for each player and determine the winner.

### Telecommunications Service Simulations

The telecom services portion of the project likely includes additional programs that simulate various telecom functionalities. Follow the same steps to compile and run those programs.

Example:

```bash
gcc -o telecom_service telecom_service.c
./telecom_service
```

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The core implementation is in C.
- **Standard C Libraries**: For input/output, memory management, and string manipulation.
